# [Earthquake Prediction](https://github.com/saroz271/DSC_530)
We are all familiar with the danger that earthquake poses. We have been taught from our young age to prepare for our safety. If we could predict when such an earthquake will occur, individuals can take preventative action, potentially saving countless lives and millions of dollars.
Using data science to predict earthquakes is a challenging problem which researchers have been trying to solve for years but with little success. A solution to this problem can save thousands of innocent lives and revolutionize disaster management. It is well known that if a disaster has happened in a region, it is likely to happen there again. Some regions really have frequent earthquakes, but this is just a comparative quantity compared to other regions. So, predicting the earthquake with Date and Time, Latitude and Longitude from previous data is not a trend which follows like other things, it is natural occurring.

Airline Safety study present the statistics of the airline fatalities and compare that with the vehicle crash report. The report illustrates that there has been significant drop in airline fatalities after 1999. Multiple metrics is created to support the study and its finding. Study and reports confirmed there has been significant drop in airline fatalities since 1999. Overall, flight incidents or fatalities are at a declining rate with the advancement of time and technology
Vehicle crash/fatalities are significantly higher compare to the air travel. The line chart shows the no of airline accidents has been significantly reduced after 1999 which strongly suggest advances in aircraft and airport design, better air traffic control, and improved pilot training.
Comparison of the airline travel incident with the road fatalities/incident found airline to be extremely safe. It provides an overview and the purpose of the study with the scope for the study.
